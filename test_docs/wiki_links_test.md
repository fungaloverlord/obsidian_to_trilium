# Wiki Links Test

This note tests various wiki link formats.

## Simple Wiki Links

Here's a link to [[basic_test]] which should link to the basic_test note.

## Wiki Links with Display Text

See the [[labels_test|Labels Example]] for label testing.

## Wiki Links with Paths

This demonstrates path-based links:
- Link to [[Questions/Stage 1 - Foundations|Stage 1]] (path syntax)
- Another example: [[Examples/Advanced Topics|Advanced]]

## Wiki Links in Lists

1. First point referencing [[callouts_test]]
2. Second point linking to [[basic_test|Basic Example]]

The note [[non_existent_note]] doesn't exist yet, so it should create a placeholder.
